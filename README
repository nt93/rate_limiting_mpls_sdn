TRADITIONAL APPROACH : MPLS
----------------------------

For running the Quagga on MPLS, the kernel first needs to be updated using the steps below.

1.Install Ubuntu 14.04 on virtual box installed on local desktop or server with console access. 
This is required since upgrading kernel requires reboot operation.
2.Download the kernel 4.4.0-31 from ìhttp://mirrors.kernel.org/î and 
install using the command ìdpkgî. After installation, reboot the machine.
3.Download the ExoGENIís image creation script and capture the local virtual machineís image. 
For more details, refer to http://www.exogeni.net/2014/06/creating-a-custom-image-from-an-existing-virtual-machine/
4.Upload the images and xml on public webserver and add the Name, URL and sha1 checksum in the file ì.flukes.propertyî.
5.Restart the fluke application and VM(s) with updated kernel should show up in available images pool.

Once the kernel is updated install Quagga using the install_Quagga.sh script.
This script includes configurations for neighborship formation in OSPF and LDP.
Chnage the router ID and neighbor IP address in the script depending on the topology
and IP addresses used.

Once the script is executed succcesully, MPLS-TE can be switched on and configured based
as required.
The steps for configuing MPLS TE can be found at: http://www.nongnu.org/quagga/docs/docs-info.html

SDN APPROACH : PSEUDO MAC 
--------------------------

1. Design the topology as required.
2. Instal OVS and RYU conroller on the exo-GENI nodes by using the scripts provided.(OVS_INSTALL.sh , RYU_CONTROLLER_INSTALL.sh)
3. The controller_application.py python file is the code used for implmenating in our projet.
4. the code base is written for a RYU based controller.
5. Run the application using ryu-manager controller_application.py syntax.
6. The paths and IP addresses defined in the controller application are for the topology used during the demo which can also be found in the power point presenattion attached.
7. If a differnet topology or a differnet set of IP addresses are used necessary changes need to be made in the code.
